# abstract
This study aims to develop an innovative algorithm for detecting and capitalizing on statistical arbitrage opportunities through pair trading. A novel approach using Dynamic Time Warping distance on pair selection for pair trading is developed. The performance of pairs will be compared with the classic Euclidean distance approach on out-of-sample testing using S\&P 500 stocksâ€™ closing prices. The result provides empirical evidence on the theoretical advantages of the Dynamic Time Warping distance approach. In addition, the optimal pair number consisting in trading portfolio is derived from the result. Based on the results, the Dynamic Time Warping distance approach has shown better profitability than the classic method and has the potential to be a successful framework for developing a pair trading strategy.
